# Project 1-College Recruitment Improvement Study
 
## Purpose of the Project

This project analyzes student enrollment data to understand the factors influencing enrollment in computing majors at CCM. The goal is to provide insights that can guide the recruiting and messaging efforts of the CCM IT Department. By analyzing survey data, we can identify key factors that drive student decisions, effective pre-college activities, and influential sources of information.

## Data Science Questions
There were 4 data science questions I answered during this project
1. What factors have the highest impact on students' decisions to enroll at CCM?
2. Which pre-college activities have the highest conversion rates to enrollment?
3. What are the most influential sources of information for students who enroll in computing courses?
4. What are the major motivations why computing majors seek a computing degree/certificate?

## Project Files
You can find 4 different project files in this GitHub Repository.
1. **Cleaned Majors Survey Results - Fall.csv** is the dataset containing student survey responses after cleaning. It includes various factors such as motivations for enrolling, influential sources of information, and participation in pre-college activities.
2. **Majors Survey Results - Fall.csv** is the original dataset containing student survey responses. This is the file we need to clean and analyzw
3. **Project 1 Part 2.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook that explores the dataset before cleaning to see what the dataset includes. It then cleans the dataset by renaming/condesing columns and removing irrelevant data. It then displays the cleaned dataset to make it easy to see the difference in the dataset.
4. **Project 1 Part 3.ipynb** is a Jupyter Notebook that performs data analysis on the cleaned survey data. It answers the data science questions using data visualization and statistics.
